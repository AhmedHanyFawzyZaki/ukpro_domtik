The applied science of Activewater means that it maximizes the use from every drop of water with incredible efficiency in the rinse cycles whilst also having a faster heating up time and refined pump performance, meaning it uses less water and less energy whilst maintaining the same great results but still being environmentally friendly and saving you money. With the SMV69T30GB Dishwasher you have 14 place settings which makes it large enough for most families. The Bosch innovative VarioDrawer design means you have a drawer on the 3rd level which replaces the cutlery basket, allowing more free space in the bottom level. The VarioDrawer can be removed easily to aid in the loading and unloading of cutlery, it also gives more space for the kitchen utensils whilst still allowing you enough space to place even long stem glasses in the upper level.  VarioFlexPlus is another feature along with 3 stage Rackmatic system; this means you can adjust the upper basket when it is fully loaded making room in the lower basket for larger items whilst also being able to make use of up to 6 foldable racks giving you the flexibility to load items of different sizes but knowing they will be guaranteed to be firm and secure.  Thanks to the Bosch technology with this dishwasher you are getting several innovations including Ecosilence making it a lot quieter and less intrusive whilst also having Aquastop antiflood which is a device that cuts off the water supply when a leak is detected to help prevent flooding. The SMV69T30GB has LED indicators to let you know when the salt and Rinse aid need refilling and there is also a time delay and a time remaining indicator. It has 6 programmes that can be accessed by touch control with an LED display and all of this is housed on the top edge of the door. The Bosch SMV69T30GB also has a Pre Rinse function that gives the items a rinse before the main wash. It has a large item spray head which makes light work of large items without the need of a pre-soak. There is an intensive zone within the dishwasher that cleans heavily soiled saucepans and delicate items all at the same time; this is because the bottom basket can receive an extra intensive wash which is excellent for burnt and baked on food but still maintaining a normal wash on the top basket with no risk to fragile items.","Bosch SMV69T30GB Built In Dishwasher","http://www.apollo2000.co.uk/showproduct/BCH-SMV69T30GB/SMV69T30GB+ActiveWater+Fully+Integrated+14+Place+Settings+Dishwasher.html","http://images.productserve.com/preview/7/5627/03/25/3065372503.jpg","Apollo Direct","5627","Dishwashers","372","0","GBP","","GBP649.00","5627"

The R270 employs an array of technical developments derived directly from Monitor Audios award winning reference speaker ranges. Excellent fidelity coupled with an elegant profile provides the opportunity to enjoy great sound and discreet design all in one package.

It's relatively easy to produce large bass in a large box, but finding the optimum mix of parameters required to generate genuinely deep dynamic bass from a space efficient Radius cabinet requires a vastly more innovative approach.  We're confident that the ultra-compact Radius 380 will elevate your expectations of what's possible in a small enclosure: the Radius 380 and its companion 390 rewrite the rules. Within the 380's diminutive cube, twin side-firing 8"" C-CAM drivers - one active and one passive ABR - work in tandem with a powerful 200W cool-running Class D amplifier (double the power of its predecessor) to deliver a seismic bass foundation for films and music, distinguished by an intoxicating blend of depth and speed.  Tuned for an utterly dynamic result with Radius satellites in film and music systems, the 380 also offers Impact, Movie and Music pre-sets for easy EQ operation.  The drivers have no grilles but are colour-coded to coordinate with cabinet finish. A 12V trigger syncs the 380 with other AV components when the system is activated.","Monitor Audio RADIUS380-BLACK AV Speakers","http://www.apollo2000.co.uk/showproduct/MON-RADIUS380-BLACK/RADIUS380BLACK+200w+Soundbar+with+Twin+8+CCAM+Drivers.html","http://images.productserve.com/preview/7/5627/11/48/3065374811.jpg","Apollo Direct","5627","Audio Equipment","5","0","GBP","","GBP499.00","5627"

A system of twin colour-coded 10"" C-CAM active/ABR drivers is powered by a 220W Class D amplifier to expand levels of output and extension, releasing a rich layer of penetrating bass, mesmerising in its consistency and scale.  You'll get agility as well, for rhythmic depth with music, and dynamic reinforcement in home theatre systems - all this from a beautiful little cube that liberates living space.

The new DEBUT Carbon has been designed to set new standards in this category for the coming decade perfectly timed as analogue today is again a respected source, while the demand for good turntables is growing again! The most obvious improvement is the inclusion of a CARBON TUBE for the tonearm, which increases stiffness and decreases unwanted resonance. This material normally is extensively used in high-end tonearms, but because of cost reasons was never used in products at lower price levels.Together with other improvements like an increase in platter size and weight to realize even smoother rotation and new design in motor suspension, the overall sound quality is greatly improved.","Project DEBUT-CARBON-BLK Turntable","http://www.apollo2000.co.uk/showproduct/PRJ-DEBUT-CARBON-BLK/DEBUTCARBON+Hifi+Turntable+with+Precision+Belt+Drive+in+Gloss+Black.html","http://images.productserve.com/preview/7/5627/45/58/3065375845.jpg","Apollo Direct","5627","DJ Equipment","19","0","GBP","","GBP324.99","5627"

The new Elemental table is a real plug'n'play all the way. No adjustment of counterweight and antiskating is needed, because both are pre-adjusted. This new straight ultra-low mass tonearm is optimised for Ortofon OM cartridge series. All the buyer needs to do is remove it from the box, remove bearing guard, locate the belt around the platter, remove stylus guard and plug it in.  The hidden secret to the new table's sonic success, is a central gravity mass point, made from artificial stone and placed directly underneath the platter bearing. It is capable to fully absorb unwanted rumble and motor vibration. This turntable appears to be pure simplicity itself, while maintaining high quality audio standards.","Project ELEMENTAL-WHITE Turntable","http://www.apollo2000.co.uk/showproduct/PRJ-ELEMENTAL-WHITE/ELEMENTALWHITE+Manual+Turntable+with+Belt+Drive+and+86+Tonearm.html","http://images.productserve.com/preview/7/5627/47/58/3065375847.jpg","Apollo Direct","5627","DJ Equipment","19","0","GBP","","GBP159.99","5627"

With Ecobubble technology it means it starts delivering even before the normal cycle begins because the unique bubble generator starts working. It will quickly penetrate the fibres in the fabric thanks to the design of using air and water together to generate the bubbles which dissolve and activate the detergent, allowing it to be just as effective in cool water without losing the same great results. Thanks to the 12Kg load capacity of the WD12F9C9U4W you can wash a bigger volume of clothes in one cycle while the dry cycle allows 8kg of laundry to be dried in one go. With its B rated spin performance the 1400rpm spin speed will remove as much water as possible making the drying time of your laundry quicker.  The Samsung WD12F9C9U4W has an A rated wash performance and one of the reasons is because of its Diamond Drum which is a unique design that will deliver optimal care to your clothes thanks to the smooth, diamond-shaped ridges which have small water exit holes which not only mean your clothes have more water contact but it also avoids your laundry fabric from becoming damaged or trapped. You don't always have a chance to do the laundry at the right time but Samsung have thought of this fact and have made it so you can now wash at any time of Day or Night without disturbing anyone. Thanks to the innovative VRT Plus (Vibration Reduction Technology) it will reduce the vibration and noise during washing by keeping the drum perfectly balanced even when at high spins so you will hardly know it is working. The Samsung offers 10 Programmes including a Pre Wash as well as wool and delicate washes whilst also boasting a 15 minute quick wash for a lightly soiled load. There is also an easy to read digital screen LCD display which is not only stylish but user friendly too so you can set the wash cycle as well as see the status of the time remaining on the cycle and thanks to its jog dial and soft press buttons you should find this simple and easy to control. And it doesn't stop there, along with its many other programmes the WD12F9C9U4W also boasts Air Wash Technology which will sanitise and deodorise your clothes by just using heated air. It can remove unpleasant odours and eliminate bacteria without the need of detergents or chemicals so without the use of water you have no need to dry them which makes this perfect for Dry clean items!","Samsung WD12F9C9U4W Washer Dryer","http://www.apollo2000.co.uk/showproduct/SAM-WD12F9C9U4W/1400rpm+White+Washer+Dryer+with+12kg+Wash+Load+8kg+Dry+Load.html","http://images.productserve.com/preview/7/5627/49/80/3138208049.jpg","Apollo Direct","5627","Washer Dryers","536","0","GBP","","GBP899.00","5627"

The A-S201 was created by taking advantage of this rich experience and high technological expertise. Based on the concept of ""Natural Sound"", for reproducing all music as it really sounds, and built with scrupulous care from circuit design to basic sound production, even though an entry model it reproduces high sound quality and musically rich sound. The A-S201, with 100W 2 high drive power that's above its class, has a high sound quality design that minimises the length of signal routes and optimises the circuit layout. Positioning the power transformer near the power amp circuit reduces power loss while improving peak power supply capacity to enable high volume output. The signal ground and power supply ground are connected at one point, eliminating mutual interference to achieve a higher S/N ratio. The result is sound filled with clarity and a feeling of openness.  Engaging the Pure Direct Switch causes the audio signal to bypass the control circuits for bass and treble, balance and the back buffer amp. This improves sound quality while maintaining full output capacity. Shortening the signal route improves sound purity, helping to reproduce even the most delicate musical nuances.  The A-S201 inherits the simple and sophisticated design style that Yamaha HiFi audio is famous for. With an elegant hair line finish, it harmonises beautifully with other HiFi audio equipment. The operating buttons and volume knobs also show our commitment to simplicity and ease of use.","Yamaha AS201-BLACK Hifi Amplifier","http://www.apollo2000.co.uk/showproduct/YAM-AS201-BLACK/AS201BLACK+200w+RMS+HiFi+Amplifier+with+Pure+Direct+Sound+Mode.html","http://images.productserve.com/preview/7/5627/33/78/3065377833.jpg","Apollo Direct","5627","HiFi Speakers","15","0","GBP","","GBP199.00","5627"

And introducing a new technology, Twisted Flare Port, for clear and tight bass. A subwoofer that will match a wide range of speakers and interiors.  The all-new Twisted Flare Port takes advantage of extensive subwoofer development experience. The flared, gently twisting shape diffuses the vortex of air generated around the edge of the port, creating a smooth flow of air. This reduces extraneous noise not present in the original input signal and provides clear, accurate low frequency reproduction. From special effect sounds in movies to the atmosphere of a live venue, you hear bass that is clear, tight and realistic.  The built-in power amplifier delivers stable power output of 130 W with high efficiency while minimizing power consumption and heat production. It does not require an output filter coil, resulting in extremely low noise and distortion. High speed transient response is also excellent. The dual feedback circuit reduces distortion by applying feedback twice, resulting in higher sound clarity.","Yamaha NSSW200-PBLACK AV Speakers","http://www.apollo2000.co.uk/showproduct/YAM-NSSW200-PBLACK/NSSW200PBLACK+130w+Subwoofer+with+20cm+Cone+Woofer+in+Black.html","http://images.productserve.com/preview/7/5627/69/78/3065377869.jpg","Apollo Direct","5627","Audio Equipment","5","0","GBP","","GBP199.99","5627"
